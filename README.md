This is **Akshita** and I welcome you all to my GitHub space. 

I am born and brought up in India and migrated to Australia along with my parents under prestigious Global Talent program. I am currently in Year 8 and studying at Willoughby Girls High School, Sydney. (One of the leaders in women's education)

I am an extremely optimistic individual and super passionate about STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) along with our core language of English to drive innovation in life.

For me "I cube" is the core mantra - "Impact", "Innovation" and "Intense Focus" to drive success!!

We thrive to become great individuals by contributing to our community and building a place where we all are sustainable to live, prosper and enjoy.

Some of my accomplishments so far can be referred as the following:
